LidLock is a signed and notarized macOS app for servers, downloads, bots, AI work, and long builds. It gives you clean controls for the Mac power settings people usually manage with Terminal commands.

LidLock requires **macOS 13 Ventura or newer**. The distributed app is signed with Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple.

## What It Does

- **Survive Lid Close** keeps your MacBook running when the lid is closed.
- **Password-free lid control** can install a signed helper from Settings so approved users do not have to enter their password every time.
- **Keep System Awake** blocks idle system sleep while LidLock runs.
- **Keep Display Awake** prevents the display from sleeping.
- **Walk Away** keeps work running while turning the display off.
- **Restore Normal Sleep** releases LidLock's protections and returns macOS to normal behavior.

LidLock always shows the real current system state, so you can see what is keeping the Mac awake and turn it off quickly.
