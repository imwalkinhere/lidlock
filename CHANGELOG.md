# Changelog

All notable public releases of LidLock are tracked here.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-06-19

Helper hotfix release.

- Fixed the password-free helper rejecting LidLock after install because the
  helper did not request its signing Team ID from Security.framework.
- Added a release check that fails if the helper cannot read the expected Team
  ID before notarization.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-06-19 (superseded)

Password-free lid control release.

This build was superseded by 1.1.1 after a helper validation bug was found. The
public release asset was removed; use 1.1.1 or newer.

- Added an optional signed privileged helper in Settings so Survive Lid Close
  can turn on and off without asking for the admin password every time.
- Added a warning dialog before installing the helper.
- Kept the normal macOS admin prompt as the fallback when the helper is off.
- Added release checks that fail if the helper or launchd plist is missing from
  the signed app.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-06-19

Maintenance release.

- Fixed a restore-on-battery policy path that could ask for admin approval a
  second time immediately after enabling Survive Lid Close while on battery.
- Kept explicit Survive Lid Close enables from being auto-undone during the
  same battery session.
- Improved menu/window state consistency while privileged operations are in
  progress.

  approval state.
